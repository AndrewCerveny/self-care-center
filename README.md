# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This is a page that gives the user a random mantra or affirmation out of a certain selection. Then there is a place where the user can display their own message if thats what they desired.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

They would need to go to my Github, fork my repository self-care. Clone it to their terminal and pull it up with the command open index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am 3 weeks into the Turing process, it took roughly 28 hours to complete.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
I was terrified to start, but once I did I saw the work flow and was able to identify where everything connected. I had to google what I didn't know. I also had to ask for help. I would do 90% of the work for a given section but knowing when and how to ask for help allowed me to progress through.  

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- Super proud of myself for starting.
- querySelectors and Event listeners where probably the most exciting because i could see the result.
- My Last affirmation was broken so i went to the label checked the values made sure they aligned and then started looking for type errors. I had a lower case t that needed to be T. Broke the whole function. Now it is fixed!
